LINKED LISTS
1. This list has 3 nodes that have as data "Apple","Berry" and "Cherry" respectively. Each node has the data and the pointer to the next node.
Meaning the box with the data, and the pointer to the next, which is the arrow.
The node "Cherry" would be the tail node, and the node "Apple" is the head node.

2.  Single linked list is the one in the figure, we can only go in one direction.
Doubled Linked is when the nodes have 2 pointers, one pointing to the next node, and one pointing to the previous node.

3. Because then we only change the pointer of the tail to point to the new node and update the 'tail' pointer to the new node.
